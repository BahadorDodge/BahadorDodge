I’m @BahadorDodge and I’m interested in anything that 0's and 1's can touch. I’m currently studying for my masters degree in modeling and simulation engineering
at Old Dominion University.

I am looking forward to collaborate with any data driven projects that can enhance my big-data and machine learning techniques. Also if you intend to run simulations
I am your guy!
